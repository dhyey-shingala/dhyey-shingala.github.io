        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Dhyey, a 24-year-old who loves to code. 
            I graduated with a master’s in computer science in May 2023, and ever since, I’ve been diving into new things—whether it’s learning more about programming or just random curiosities that grab my attention.
            Music is a huge part of my life. 
            My Sony WH-1000XM4s are with me everywhere, and my playlists are a mix of pretty much every genre you can think of. 
            When I’m not coding or jamming to music, I like to stay active by walking (hitting those 10,000 steps daily!) and hiking whenever I get the chance.            
            I speak Gujarati, Hindi, and English fluently, and I’m working on picking up Spanish. 
            Living in the Bay Area has been great for tech events, from developer meetups to hackathons—there’s always something going on! 
            I also enjoy playing games, though I don’t have as much time for that these days.
        </p>

        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            I believe in writing code that stands the test of time. 
            Software that doesn't rely on external frameworks is inherently more robust, as it remains functional even as specific functions or methods may become deprecated. 
            This approach ensures longevity and sustainability, allowing the software to work indefinitely.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I advocate for a minimal aesthetic. 
            I prioritize functionality over frills and glitter, believing that simplicity enhances user experience and maintains focus on what truly matters. 
            Clean, efficient design is not just visually appealing; it also fosters clarity and usability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, I emphasize the importance of simplicity in software development. 
            Avoiding complexity is crucial; I strive to keep everything straightforward and easy to understand. 
            By doing so, I ensure that everyone, regardless of their technical background, can comprehend and engage with the software effectively.
        </p>
